// 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game
// Solved
// Medium
// Topics
// Companies
// Hint
// There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

// The rules of the game are as follows:

// Start at the 1st friend.
// Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
// The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
// If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
// Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
// Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.
